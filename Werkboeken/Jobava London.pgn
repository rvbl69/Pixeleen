1. d4 d5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bf4 $1 { Welcome to my Chess Opening Course of the Rapport-Jobava London System! The Rapport-Jobava London System is a infallible opening which is moderately low and theory and quite easy to play. This Opening system is very flexible. Bf4 Nc3 Targets are on the queenside. This Opening System meets both aggressive and positional player's desire and objective. Either tamed or bewildered the choice is up to you! }  
Bf5 4. Nb5 {[%cal Rb5c7,Rf4c7,Yb8a6,Ya6c7][%csl Rb5,Rc7] Nb5 might sound elementary but either ways it actually part well! Why is that? What's the purpose behind the move Nb5? Doesn't that sound elementary? SGM Hikaru Nakamura once threw a tantrum and said this was garbage when Naroditsky successfully forked Hikaru due to premove. Funny enough Nb5 is actually a very good idea in the Rapport-Jobava London System. First it forces black to make this horrible move Na6!? The only saving move thus a misplaced knight! This messes up black's structure. It would take at least two tempos before black would be able to bring his knight into a better square! Nb3 forces black to do the uncanny. Keep that in your mind! }  
(4. e3 { continuum: This is my recommendation. White immediately prepares f3-g4-h4: }  
e6 5. f3 c5 6. g4 Bg6 7. h4 { For example }  h6 (7... h5 8. g5 Nfd7 9. Nb5) 8. 
Nb5) 4... Na6 { An uncanny and crampy move. Would take at least two tempos before black could reroute his knight to a better place. Knight on the rim Nh6!? A forced defensive move! }  
5. a3 { a3! To avoid complications since the position follows the same idea of the Rapport Jobava London System with black having to step forward with Nb4! After c6! Pawn to a3 is pretty much forced in here. }  
c6 { The only good move is c6 in here. Everything else is too passive. Pawn to c6 of course threatens to take the knight thus forcing it to be evicted to the b5 square. }  
(5... c5 { c5 is another provacative move which doesn't really sound very well because this further opens up the dark squares around b8-f4. Position looks exploitable for white. Black needed to counter white's dark square bishop before commiting to the move c5! }  
6. dxc5 Ne4 7. b4 { White at ease was able to anchor the c5 pawn. White is up a piece whereas black gets little compensation for the pawn sacrifice. }  
g5 8. Be5 f6 9. Bc3)  (5... e6 { e6 strengthens the center and black is planning to counter white's dark square bishop with c6 thus kicking away the knight followed by Bd6! }  
6. e3 c6 7. Nc3 Bd6 8. Bxd6 { Other ideas includes the move Bg3, but I prefer bishop takes bishop followed by f4! To strengthen white's control on the e5 square. }  
Qxd6 9. f4 O-O 10. Nf3 Nc7 11. Bd3) 6. Nc3 e6 { Now black gets some sort of a Semi-Slav with the bishop on f5 and a knight on a rim a6 }  
7. e3 Be7 8. Be2 O-O 9. g4 { More of a provacative move I have to admit. White lashes out on the kingside with ideas of launching a pawn storm on the kingside. }

1. d4 d5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bf4 { This particular chapter is dedicated to the"One" and "Only" main line Horwitz Defence against the Jobava London. The Horwitz Defence can basically be played against everything. By everything I mean "Everything". It can be played against the Queen's Gambit, Catalan Opening, English Opening, London System, King's Indian Attack, and so on.Basically in here black's simple plan is to occupy the center, reinforce a hasty attack either on the center or the queenside depending on white's play. So on and so forth in the Jobava, the system remains very different. The idea of Bf4 Nd5 is one of the key factor why the Horwitz's auto piloted move order wouldn't fit very well. Remember the idea of Bf4 Nd5! huh? Black either have to play a6 or Na6 just to stop this. Thus a tempo ahead and a complicatedly matter on the queenside makes this position quite unbearable! }  
e6 { This moved has been played most of the time. The standard Horwitz Defence against every system. Problem in here is that black allowed white to play Nb5! Which is the reason why black cannot go auto pilot against the Jobava London unless the Nb5 threat has been covered. }  
(3... a6 4. e3 b5 { Black expands with a few ideas of attacking chances. In particular the queenside. }  
(4... c5 $5 { Black challenges white's center. But in exchange white gets an extra tempo whereas black would get little compensation on the prized center. }  
5. dxc5 e6 (5... Qa5 $6 { Unnecessary since moving your queen on the rim would only waste a tempo. Besides black has to make plans which piece will he use to recapture the c pawn. With the queen?! Loses two tempos. }  
6. Nf3 Qxc5 7. Qd3 { Flexible position, white is free to castle on the queenside which in this case gives black attacking chances on the kingside. }  
Nbd7 8. O-O-O) 6. Bd3 $1 { Favorable position, flexible and stable development. White should make plans when to castle. }  
Bxc5 7. Nf3 Nc6 8. O-O b5 { White's objective is to open up the center with the move e4! }  
9. e4 O-O 10. a3)  (4... Bf5 5. Nf3 e6 6. Be2 Be7 7. Ne5 { The e5 square is often a good outpost. Keep that idea in mind would you? }  
O-O 8. O-O Nc6 9. g4 $1 { With attacking chances on tbe kingside but not necessarily what you should do. You can leave the position before g4 and stick with your plans and objectives. }

$1 {[%cal Rb8a6,Rb5c7] The threat of fork between the king and rook can only be stopped by Na6. This horribly looking move makes the knight dislodged from the game. It is misplaced, stuck on the rim and has to spend two tempos just to reinforce the knight into a better square. }  
Na6 (4... Bd6 $6 { Another alternative which doesn't require the move Na6 to defend. This may seem like a good option since this also strengthens black's center in the future. But either ways you can't sleep too much on a sleep over! The problem behind this is that after knight takes bishop. White would have the bishop pair. }  
5. Nxd6+ cxd6 6. e3 Nc6 7. Nf3 O-O 8. h3 Re8 9. c3 e5 10. Bh2 { Despite of black's effort in breaking up the center. There's really not much to be done in here for black since white's center is well fortified. }

1. d4 d5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bf4 c5 {[%cal Gc3b5] In this particular chapter we would be talking about the "Steinitz Countergambit"This effective Anti-London is known to quickly equalize or even have a better position against the London System. That is because after c5 all what white can do is react and defend consequently. After c5 Black would proceed with Qb6! White has to defend the b pawn or otherwise lose a piece.Despite of this, today's modern theory had successfully repealed and made amends to the Anti-London "Steinitz Countergambit" where white sacrifice a pawn for piece activity.But does this "Stenitz Countergambit" be an effective Anti-London against the Rapport-Jobava? We'll see... }  
4. e3 { The Anti-London "Steinitz Countergambit" wouldn't ever be an effective as it is against the London System. That is because the knight is on f3, with move such as Rb1 the b pawn is finally protected. Now black's queen end up being misplaced on b6 without anything better to do. }  
cxd4 { Let's take a look at this wing c pawn takes center d pawn. Black has successfully take away one of white's center pawn against a wing pawn. Leaving black with a strong initiative with the d and e center pawns.But not to worry! White's aim is piece development. White is ahead of development and white's play would divert on the center. }  
(4... Bg4 { An energetic move which provokes white to either move the queen out or f3! Two choices in here, but f3 is the most strongest amongst the purist since this forces black's bishop to be evicted. }  
5. f3 Bd7 (5... Bh5 $6 { Would be of no use since g4! Black would have wasted two tempos and white's devastating blow on the kingside would provoke black's kingside. }  
6. g4 Bg6 7. g5 $1 { White has a very strong initiative and attack on the kingside. Black would have a difficult time handling white's initiative on the kingside since white's attack has been fueled by black's own tempos. }  
Nh5 (7... cxd4 8. Nb5 Qa5+ 9. c3 dxc3 10. Nc7+) 8. Bxb8 $3 { Please, never EVER do this without any tactical justification. Bishop takes knight forces black to take with the queen this losing the central d pawn. Otherwise if rook takes bishop then Bb4+! Black is obligated to sacrifice a queen for it is the only option to continue the game. }  
Qxb8 (8... Rxb8 9. Bb5+ Qd7 10. Bxd7+) 9. Bb5+ Kd8 10. Nxd5 { White Is already up a piece thus winning. Black's pieces are a laughingstock. With no Incentive or initiative of the pawn sacrifice and delayed development. Might as well as just resign in here. } 
) 6. Qd2 $1 { Qd2! With clear intention of castling queenside. White's play would divert on the kingside. With the help of the f3 pawn g4 h4 would come in blitz maneuver. }  
Nc6 7. O-O-O e6 8. g4 $1 { "Attack Attack Attack Attack!" Push em baby yeah? Don't forget h4 soon. Would have been a great idea to play later on. }  
Be7 9. Nge2 O-O 10. h4)  (4... e6 $6 { Pretty much straightforward. Black wants to avoid complication and settled for e6?! to protect the c pawn. Why is this inaccurate you might ask? Well Nb5 and black is forced to give in with Na6. A knight on a rim. Misplaced and horrible. Wouldn't want that would you? }  
5. Nb5 Na6 { Na6 the only good move to stop the threat of knight on c2+ with a fork. Na6 although force is an unfeasible and ugly move since the knight is on the rim and it is misplaced! Would take two tempos just to straighten it up. }  
(5... Qa5+ $4 { b4! Black is forced to take with a check! Nc2 is inevitable in here. Black's queen is forced to take the pawn. After queen takes pawn with a check c3! Thus black cannot stop the idea of fork. The fork with the king and rook with the knight cannot be stopped. }  
6. b4 { Black is forced to take the knight thus losing a tempo and the fork on c2 with the knight cannot be stopped }  
Qxb4+ 7. c3 Qb2 8. Rb1 Qxa2 9. Nc7+) 6. c3 { Pyramid pawn structure as always seen in the London, Colle System or even the Slav Defence. White has a powerful center in here. }  
Bd7 7. a4 c4 { Since white's pawn is on a4. c4 was made possible. Threat of b3 wouldn't be of any danger for black since he can simply take followed by Nc2 and onwards. }  
8. Na3 { Na3 just to shift away the knight from being taken by black's light square bishop thus creating a double b pawn. Although the pressure on the queenside would give white some attacking changes... I'm afraid the double b pawn creates more of a problem and risk since it would be hard to defend or anchor it. }

5. Nb5 Na6 6. dxc5 { Only good move is to take with the queen. Knight takes pawn is bad because Nc2+! Losing the rook. }  
Qxc5 7. Be5 { With clear intention of Be4 then Nxa7. }  Bd7 8. Bd4 Qc8 9. Nxa7 
Qb8 10. Bxf6 gxf6 11. Nb5 { White wins a piece! } ) 5. exd4 Bg4 { An energetic move which provokes white to either move the queen out or f3! Two choices in here, but f3 is the most strongest amongst the purist since this forces black's bishop to be evicted. }  
6. f3 (6. Be2 { Another safer approach would have been to play Be2, just to keep things straight without risk I guess. }  
Bxe2 7. Ngxe2 Nc6 8. Nc1 $5 { With idea of Ne3! To centralize the pawn onwards!  }  
e6 9. O-O Be7 10. N3e2 { Knight maneuver to keep in touch with the f4 square. }

Isn't really useful since bishop takes knight, black would easily equalize and keep things balanced or under control.We play Bd3 to control the f5 square. Black's light square bishop would have been stuck down there under the gutter (Black's pyramid) }  
Nc6 (7... Qb6 $1 { As mentioned before Qb6 doesn't generally work because of Nb5 and the "Reinforcable" Rb1. But in here with the light square bishop on e6 Nb5 isn't possible. To make amends to this simply Qd2 long castle 0-0-0 is a way to go! }  
8. Nge2 a6 9. Qd2 e6 10. O-O-O Nc6 { With ideas of Nb4 and of course simply winning the d pawn. White has to defend. }  
11. Qe3 { Supports the d4 pawn. }  Nb4 12. a3 Nxd3+ 13. Rxd3 Qc6 14. g4 { Black has the queenside, White has the kingside. Interesting position indeed! } 
) 8. Nge2 { Anchors the d4 pawn. Bg3 and Nf4 is quite a lovely idea in the near future. }  
Rc8 9. g4 $1 { An energetic move in which white wants to shove a devastating attack on black's kingside! What else could you ask for huh? }  
e6 10. Qd2 Nb4 11. Nc1 { Nc1, in case of knight takes bishop we would successfully get our knight centralized. Feasible and favorable! }  
Nxd3+ 12. Nxd3 Be7 {[%cal Yh2h4][%csl Yh4] Attack, attack, attack, attack! }  
13. h4 O-O 14. O-O-O {[%cal Yh1h8,Yd1g1,Ra7a5,Yh4h5,Rb7b5,Yg2g8,Yg4g5] White does not have to worry about getting attacked by black. White's attack on the kingside would have been a devastating blow which provokes black to make amends and postpone the attack on the queenside. }

1. d4 Nf6 { Nf6 black wants to divert the game into a King's Indian or a Semi-Grunfeld structure. But in here after the move Nc3! Black would have to play d4 thus transposing back to the position we studied with the Horwitz Defence. Well other than that if black refuses and play g6!? Then simply e4! The move pawn to e4 was made possible because of the knight on c3. Black would have to play d5 or d6!? We'll get into that. }  
2. Nc3 { White wants to play e4! Black has to play d5 or otherwise if let's say for example g6!? Aiming for a Grunfeld or King's Indian structure. Then simply e4! Then white is roughly doing better than black with his central advantage. }  
g6 $5 {[%cal Ge2e4,Gf2f4][%csl Ge4,Gf4] The move g6!? Allows the move e4! Giving white spacious and central advantage. }  
3. e4 { Simply taking over the center. Was made possible because of the knight to c3 move order. }  
d6 { There are two particular variations in which I recommend in here. The Austrian Attack or the "English" or "Yugoslavia" Attack structure. Everything heavily depends on your decision. }  
4. Be3 $1 { Be3! Is a very suitable and feasible system against the King's Indian or pirc with the Jobava London System. White is settling for the "English" or"Yugoslavia" structure where white castles queenside. Plays f3 followed by g4! and h4! A continuous attack on the devastated kingside! }  
(4. f4 { f4! The Austrian Attack. The Austrian attack is suitable for positional players who want to gain spacious advantage. White's attack would either divert on the center or kingside (Via Bird/Dutch Kingside Attack). }  
Bg7 5. Nf3 { Bishop to e2 followed by short castle 0-0 should be enough and feasible for white's particular position. I do believe that white has the advantage in here because of the spacious advantage. }  
O-O 6. Bd3 { Two main moves, either Nc6 or even c5!? Both of which are included in here.For starters knight to c6 prevents black from making progress on the central breakthrough since the c5 pawn is blockaded. On the other hand c5 tempts white to exchange pieces and simplify. }  
Nbd7 { Let's just say black doesn't really do anything aside from going forward with his usual King's Indian or Pirc structure and idea. That is the breakthroughs with c5 or Re8 e5! Well simply e5! White gains a favorable position with a spacious advantage. }  
(6... Nc6 $5 { White should play e4! With the help of the Nc6!? Move order black would have quite a problem with pawn breakthroughs in here. }

Kh8 14. c3)  (6... c5 { Quick tip in the Austrian Attack: It would perhaps be better if white were to give up the center if black's main objective is to throw as much pieces as possible in breaking up the center. I've been through many positions such as the Advance Caro Kann, French, and even Pirc. I've gotten the spacious advantage but the problem is black's main objective shifted on the center. I've tried to hold unto it until it became my untimely downfall.So general rule would have been to '"Give up the center if necessary". }  
7. dxc5 dxc5 8. e5 {[%cal Rd1e2,Rc1d2,Re1c1] Wherever the knight goes. White's idea is Qe2 Bd2 0-0-0 followed by g4! Attacking black's center. }

Simply develop and stick with your opening principals and fundamentals. You can't just heavily anchor your pawn journey with openings. Cannot be fixated like that. You can't sleep too much on a sleep over! }  
8. Be3 c5 9. O-O { As a general advice "Give up the center of necessary" White has to give up the center or otherwise have some dents and iniquities on the center. I'm the Pirc or King's Indian black heavily relies on the pawn breakthroughs with c5, e5, or even f5! You cannot just defend and defend and defend! You wouldn't like that!Rather than being busy defending and giving out tenacious fortification which is roughly exhausting. Simply give up the center an d you'll be fine. }  
cxd4 10. Bxd4 dxe5 11. fxe5 Nxe5 12. Bxe5 Bxe5 13. Nxe5 { Qd4 with a check and fork is the main idea in here. But nevertheless the f file is open and white has a very good position in here. }  
Qd4+ 14. Kh1 Qxe5 15. Qd2 Nf6 {[%cal Ra1e1][%csl Re1]}  16. Rae1 { White is up in development and roughly dominating black's position. Black's forces is outmatched against white's active and we'll placed forces. } 
) 4... Bg7 5. Qd2 Nbd7 { Simply castle queenside and you would most likely be fine. Black would aim for the queenside whereas white would aim for the kingside. A double edged sword indeed! }  
6. O-O-O Ng4 { One of the most common idea amongst positional players. Chop off the pieces who are currently active in participation on the objectified goal. }  
(6... b6 $5 { We would take a look at what would happen if black were to ignore everything else on the plate and decided to go for a quiet but simple objective with Re8 and e5! }  
7. f3 { Simply f3 followed by g4! b4! and h4! Quick reminder that you should first develop your pieces and organize them in according divisions but with same objective of winning. The others will defend whereas the others would attack! }  
Bb7 8. Kb1 O-O 9. Nge2 { Could be reinforced to c1 in case black shoves a pawn storm on the queenside. }  
Rc8 10. g4 $1 { "To Be Continued" } ) 7. Bf4 { We can't exchange our precious and noble dark square bishop! That's our key piece in attacking black's well fortified kingside! }  
e5 { Time to give up the center! }  8. dxe5 dxe5 9. Bg3 { White dominates on the d file. }  
Bh6 10. f4 O-O 11. Be2 Ngf6 (11... f5 {[%cal Ya2g8] A logical continuation but heavily weakens the light squares around black's position. }  
12. exf5 gxf5 13. Nf3 c6 14. Ng5) 12. h4 { The Attack continues! }  Qe7 13. h5 
exf4 14. Bxf4 Bxf4 15. Qxf4 c6 16. Rf1 { I would prefer white in here. Although the opening sequences and move order is quite dubious. White's idea of attacking kingside has never been so difficult indeed! }

Doesn't that sound elementary? SGM Hikaru Nakamura once threw a tantrum and said this was garbagr when Naroditsky successfully forked Hikaru due to premove. Funny enough Nb5 is actually a very good idea in the Rapport-Jobava London System. First it forces black to make this horrible move Na6!? The only saving move thus a misplaced knight! This messes up black's structure. It would take at least two tempos before black would be able to bring his knight into a better square! Nb3 forces black to do the uncanny. Keep that in your mind! }

White has to defend the b pawn or otherwise lose a piece.Despite of this, today's modern theory had successfully repealed and made amends to the Anti-London "Steinitz Countergambit" where white sacrifice a pawn for piece activity.But does this "Stenitz Countergambit" be an effective Anti-London against the Rapport-Jobava?

Nf6 3. Bf4 { This particular chapter is dedicated to the"One" and "Only" main line Horwitz Defence against the Jobava London. The Horwitz Defence can basically be played against everything. By everything I mean "Everything". It can be played against the Queen's Gambit, Catalan Opening, English Opening, London System, King's Indian Attack, and so on.Basically in here black's simple plan is to occupy the center, reinforce a hasty attack either on the center or the queenside depending on white's play. So on and so forth in the Jobava, the system remains very different. The idea of Bf4 Nd5 is one of the key factor why the Horwitz's auto piloted move order wouldn't fit very well. Remember the idea of Bf4 Nd5! huh? Black either have to play a6 or Na6 just to stop this. Thus a tempo ahead and a complicatedly matter on the queenside makes this position quite unbearable! ; The Rapport-Jobava London System is a infallible opening which is moderately low and theory and quite easy to play. This Opening system is very flexible. Bf4 Nc3 Targets are on the queenside. This Opening System meets both aggressive and positional player's desire and objective. Either tamed or bewildered the choice is up to you! }  
g6 { Some sort of a Semi-Grunfeld. White should just continue with his standard set up. But aside from that everything is working well from here. ;   This is a grunfeld line }  
(3... e6 { This moved has been played most of the time. The standard Horwitz Defence against every system. Problem in here is that black allowed white to play Nb5! Which is the reason why black cannot go auto pilot against the Jobava London unless the Nb5 threat has been covered. }  
4. Nb5 $1 {[%cal Rb8a6,Rb5c7] The threat of fork between the king and rook can only be stopped by Na6. This horribly looking move makes the knight dislodged from the game. It is misplaced, stuck on the rim and has to spend two tempos just to reinforce the knight into a better square. }  
Na6 (4... Bd6 $6 { Another alternative which doesn't require the move Na6 to defend. This may seem like a good option since this also strengthens black's center in the future. But either ways you can't sleep too much on a sleep over! The problem behind this is that after knight takes bishop. White would have the bishop pair. }

1. d4 d5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bf4 { This particular chapter is dedicated to the"One" and "Only" main line Horwitz Defence against the Jobava London. The Horwitz Defence can basically be played against everything. By everything I mean "Everything". It can be played against the Queen's Gambit, Catalan Opening, English Opening, London System, King's Indian Attack, and so on.Basically in here black's simple plan is to occupy the center, reinforce a hasty attack either on the center or the queenside depending on white's play. So on and so forth in the Jobava, the system remains very different. The idea of Bf4 Nd5 is one of the key factor why the Horwitz's auto piloted move order wouldn't fit very well. Remember the idea of Bf4 Nd5! huh? Black either have to play a6 or Na6 just to stop this. Thus a tempo ahead and a complicatedly matter on the queenside makes this position quite unbearable! }  
e6 { This moved has been played most of the time. The standard Horwitz Defence against every system. Problem in here is that black allowed white to play Nb5! Which is the reason why black cannot go auto pilot against the Jobava London unless the Nb5 threat has been covered. }

Bf4 c5 {[%cal Gc3b5] In this particular chapter we would be talking about the "Steinitz Countergambit"This effective Anti-London is known to quickly equalize or even have a better position against the London System. That is because after c5 all what white can do is react and defend consequently. After c5 Black would proceed with Qb6! White has to defend the b pawn or otherwise lose a piece.Despite of this, today's modern theory had successfully repealed and made amends to the Anti-London "Steinitz Countergambit" where white sacrifice a pawn for piece activity.But does this "Stenitz Countergambit" be an effective Anti-London against the Rapport-Jobava? We'll see... }  
4. e3 { The Anti-London "Steinitz Countergambit" wouldn't ever be an effective as it is against the London System. That is because the knight is on f3, with move such as Rb1 the b pawn is finally protected. Now black's queen end up being misplaced on b6 without anything better to do. }  
cxd4 { Let's take a look at this wing c pawn takes center d pawn. Black has successfully take away one of white's center pawn against a wing pawn. Leaving black with a strong initiative with the d and e center pawns.But not to worry! White's aim is piece development. White is ahead of development and white's play would divert on the center. }

1. d4 Nf6 { Nf6 black wants to divert the game into a King's Indian or a Semi-Grunfeld structure. But in here after the move Nc3! Black would have to play d4 thus transposing back to the position we studied with the Horwitz Defence. Well other than that if black refuses and play g6!? Then simply e4! The move pawn to e4 was made possible because of the knight on c3. Black would have to play d5 or d6!? We'll get into that. }  
2. Nc3 { White wants to play e4! Black has to play d5 or otherwise if let's say for example g6!? Aiming for a Grunfeld or King's Indian structure. Then simply e4! Then white is roughly doing better than black with his central advantage. }  
g6 $5 {[%cal Ge2e4,Gf2f4][%csl Ge4,Gf4] The move g6!? Allows the move e4! Giving white spacious and central advantage. }  
3. e4 { Simply taking over the center. Was made possible because of the knight to c3 move order. }  
d6 { There are two particular variations in which I recommend in here. The Austrian Attack or the "English" or "Yugoslavia" Attack structure. Everything heavily depends on your decision. }  
4. Be3 $1 { Be3! Is a very suitable and feasible system against the King's Indian or pirc with the Jobava London System. White is settling for the "English" or"Yugoslavia" structure where white castles queenside. Plays f3 followed by g4! and h4! A continuous attack on the devastated kingside! }  
(4. f4 { f4! The Austrian Attack. The Austrian attack is suitable for positional players who want to gain spacious advantage. White's attack would either divert on the center or kingside (Via Bird/Dutch Kingside Attack). }  
Bg7 5. Nf3 { Bishop to e2 followed by short castle 0-0 should be enough and feasible for white's particular position. I do believe that white has the advantage in here because of the spacious advantage. }  
O-O 6. Bd3 { Two main moves, either Nc6 or even c5!? Both of which are included in here.For starters knight to c6 prevents black from making progress on the central breakthrough since the c5 pawn is blockaded. On the other hand c5 tempts white to exchange pieces and simplify. }  
Nbd7 { Let's just say black doesn't really do anything aside from going forward with his usual King's Indian or Pirc structure and idea. That is the breakthroughs with c5 or Re8 e5! Well simply e5! White gains a favorable position with a spacious advantage. }

Kh8 14. c3)  (6... c5 { Quick tip in the Austrian Attack: It would perhaps be better if white were to give up the center if black's main objective is to throw as much pieces as possible in breaking up the center. I've been through many positions such as the Advance Caro Kann, French, and even Pirc. I've gotten the spacious advantage but the problem is black's main objective shifted on the center.

Simply develop and stick with your opening principals and fundamentals. You can't just heavily anchor your pawn journey with openings. Cannot be fixated like that. You can't sleep too much on a sleep over! }  
8. Be3 c5 9. O-O { As a general advice "Give up the center of necessary" White has to give up the center or otherwise have some dents and iniquities on the center. I'm the Pirc or King's Indian black heavily relies on the pawn breakthroughs with c5, e5, or even f5! You cannot just defend and defend and defend! You wouldn't like that!Rather than being busy defending and giving out tenacious fortification which is roughly exhausting. Simply give up the center an d you'll be fine. }

(6... b6 $5 { We would take a look at what would happen if black were to ignore everything else on the plate and decided to go for a quiet but simple objective with Re8 and e5! }

1. d4 e5 { As part of my extensive London Buckingham course. I think that this particular gambit needs to be covered. I've faced this so many times and I have to admit I didn't really know the refutation into this and I didn't seem to care (Too lazy to study it.) As a result I've lost many games. I didn't want those things to happen aswell to you. So as I result I included the refutation to the Englund Gambit aswell! The Englund Gambit is a well recognized trap in which black sacrifices a pawn after the move d4 then e5! Black would be aggrevated and would try his best to prove his initiative. }
